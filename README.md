# yutefantasy
Yute Fantasy is a classic league in the fantasy premier league.
This repo contains code written to help determine the manager of the week.

This project was written using Flask.
However, the actual logic isn't written here. It's written in an API.
This project only calls the API and returns the value in very basic html (no styling yet, I suck at front-end LOL)

Anyone is free to help out with the styling of the page.
